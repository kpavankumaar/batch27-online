		<h3>CRITIC'S REVIEW</h3>
		<p>
			ARJUN REDDY STORY: A brilliant medico who’s the topper of his class has anger management issues. What happens when he loses control of his life due to an unforeseen incident? Does he get a chance at redemption?	
		</p>

		<p>
			ARJUN REDDY REVIEW: Arjun Reddy (Vijay Deverakonda) is a vintage Bullet-riding, football-playing, angry, young final year medico who believes his actions are always justified. Preeti (Shalini Pandey), a first year student, walks into his life and it is love at first sight for the protagonist. She is a stark contrast to everything he is and at first, it seems like he bullies her into spending time with him. But time passes, love blossoms, passion roars, and nowhere does his fire lessen.

		</p>
		<p>
		But things change; circumstances force Arjun away from his love and he seems to hit rock bottom with a force that’s surprising, yet expected. He turns into a modern day Devadas, complete with a dog by his side. From a brilliant young man whose only issue was his anger, he turns into a raging alcoholic who smokes pot during his downtime and does coke whenever it gets too much. Despite all this, he continues to practice as a surgeon at a hospital till life threatens to throw him on his back again.
		</p>
		<p>
		There’s one dialogue in the movie that perfectly sums up the character of Arjun Reddy. Priyadarshi, who plays a cameo in the film, calls Arjun a ‘free spirited individual in a democratic world’. There’s nothing more apt than that to describe a character that you would both love and fear if you met him in real life. With ‘Arjun Reddy’, Sandeep Vanga has managed to tell a story that is seldom told, without sleaze or cheesy lines or OTT drama.
