Document Object Model 

Document object in browser has information about elements(objects) in a structured way . 
As this structure is acceptable to all browsers we call it as a model 

DOM is an interface that allows user to access the objects (elements) .
we can use programming languages like javascript to access DOM and give set of instruction to perform an action.

DOM manipulation 

first step to Manipulate elements (objects ) is to choose elements using DOM
 1. document.getElementsByTagName('elementname');
 2. document.getElementsByClass('elementname');
 3. document.getElementById('id-value');

 whenever we see 'getElements' then it would return array of objects 
 and if we see 'getElement' this will return single object 

Binding events 
 defining type of input that a object has to respond is what is event binding . 
 type of input can be either keyboard or mouse event.
 example 
 	var gallery = document.getElementsByTagName('ul');
 	var listItems = document.getElementsByTagName('li');
 	gallery[0].onclick = function(){
 	 	console.log('you clicked on ul element');
 	 }
 	

Bubbling and Capturing 
	gallery[0].addEventListener('click',function(){
 		console.log('you clicked on ul element');
 	},true);
 	listItems[0].addEventListener('click',function(){
 		console.log('you clicked on li element');
 	},true);

Bubbling and capturing will define the order of response for event triggered on parent and child elements.
Bubbling - event on child element is first triggered and followed by parent
Capturing - event on parent element is first triggered and followed by child element

addEventListener is one of the ways of registering events on objects.
it can accept few arguments 
	a. first argument is event 
	b. second argument is function that browser has to read 
	c. third argument is Boolean value ,will result in either bubbling or capturing . False will lead to Bubbling and True - capturing
