		// REG EXPRESSION 
		// Identify hexdecimal value for background colors applied in input field 
		// FORWARD SLASH / - is used at the begining of the reg expression  and at the ending of regular expression
		// example - #AA0011
		// /#?[0123456789ABCDEF]/ 

		//			-- this regular expression would return 6matches for the example #AA0011
		//			-- if we 'i' right after grouping then reg exp would return one match (AA0011)
		// 'hash value is made optional when we add ? after the # in reg expression' 
		/#?[0-9a-fA-F]{6}|[0-9a-fA-F]{3}/i 
			1.this will Identify the lowercase hexdecimal value and 3 character hexdecimal value
			2.by adding the or '|' operator we made reg exp support 3 character hexdecimal value or 6 hexdecimal value 
			3. # becomes optional as we have added ? after # value .
			4. # is optional for both 6 character hexadecimal and 3 character hexdecimal
			5. Curly braces are useful to match the number of characters .
			6. regexp has i after the ending forward slash this is called as pattern modifier 
			7. 'i' will make the reg exp case insensitive 

		
		?*+{} - quantifiers 
		[ ... ] - character ranges
		(...|...) - Grouping and alternation 
		^ ...$ - Anchors 

		positive 
		[abcdef] , [a-f] 


		[a-f0-9] caracter ranges 
		
		negtive 
		[^abcdef] , [^a-f] ,[^a-f0-9]

		matching special character 
		if you want to match ^ or - or [ from a string then place these special character in the middle or end of character class.
			example : [a-z1-9-^\[]	
				backslash is used to make the following character a literal match in the string.
		. -> dot will select everything except for new line \n
		[.]	-> it will loose its special meaning , means it will literally match dot in the string

		example: one.*s.?t[a-z]+p.{2,}
